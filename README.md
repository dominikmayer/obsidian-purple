I found myself in an ancient library, its shelves stretching into infinity under a dim, mysterious light. Among the endless rows, a book with a cover that shimmered like stardust caught my eye. Just as my fingers grazed its spine, it fluttered away, leading me through a labyrinth of shelves. This chase brought me to a serene clearing where the duck from earlier awaited, its feathers aglow with an ethereal light. It spoke with a voice that resonated with both familiarity and otherworldliness, imparting wisdom that felt profound yet slipped away upon waking.
Â§Â§Â§

Today's adventure took us to the heart of the city, yet away from its clamor: Central Park. A green oasis amidst the concrete jungle, each path and bench tells a story. Our first stop was the Bethesda Terrace, its intricate stonework and arches a testament to craftsmanship and vision.

Not far from there, the Bow Bridge presented a picturesque scene, its graceful curve reflecting on the calm lake waters, a perfect moment captured in the soft afternoon light.

While walking home, Karen shared a joke that unexpectedly lightened the mood:

.Doctor: I'm sorry but you suffer from a terminal illness and have only 10 to live.
.Patient (anxiously): What do you mean, 10?
.Patient: 10 what?
.Patient: Months?
.Patient: Weeks?!
.Doctor: Nine.
.Patient: ðŸ˜³
```
