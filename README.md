## Yesterday

This plugin lets you create and edit a [Yesterday](https://www.yesterday.md) journal in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

I supports advanced formatting for journal entries including support for

- dialogs
- dreams
- media [content blocks](https://ia.net/writer/support/library/content-blocks)

Example:

```
---
date: 2010-02-02 17:05:32 -04:00
location:
    name: Times Square, New York, USA
    latitude: 40.7580
    longitude: -73.9855
weather:
    summary: Icy
    temperature: 3.06
    sky: partly-cloudy-day

Saw a **flying duck** today. Tried to follow. Didn't work. Karen caught it on video:

On the way home she found this lame joke:

.Doctor: I'm sorry but you suffer from a terminal illness and have only 10 to live.
.Patient (concerned): What do you mean, 10? 10 what? Months? Weeks?!
.Doctor: Nine.
.Patient: ðŸ˜³
```

### Journal vault

If you have your journal in its own vault you can

- clean up the sidebar to show only notes and hide all media and
- color code open and closed entries.

Icons and commands (that can be activated by [hotkeys](https://help.obsidian.md/User+interface/Hotkeys)) let you

- create new entries at the right location and
- toggle entries between open and closed.

You can show the number of open entries in the status bar.
